                content: `The world returned to Ashravan not as a memory, but as a fresh coat of paint on a cracked wall. He could feel the seams of Shai’s work, a masterful forgery that was now his soul. He was lucid, brilliant even, possessing knowledge of statecraft and scripture he’d never learned. Yet, a phantom limb of his old self remained—the broken arbiter, the man who had failed, whose mind had been shattered into dust. This ghost whispered of inadequacies, a constant hum beneath the symphony of his new competence.

He served the new Emperor with a diligence that was both innate and programmed. He saw patterns in law and finance that others missed, his counsel becoming invaluable. But he avoided mirrors, fearing he would see a stranger staring back, a puppet whose strings were pulled by a long-gone artist.

The crisis came without warning. A rogue Soul-forger, a heretic from a distant land, had breached the Imperial Palace’s defenses, not with soldiers, but with a creeping magical decay. The very stones of the palace were being rewritten, their essence unraveled into chaos. The Imperial Guard’s weapons passed through the shimmering walls, and the arbiters’ edicts dissolved before they could take effect.

Panic set in. As the foundations groaned, threatening to collapse, Ashravan stepped into the epicenter of the decay. He closed his eyes, shutting out the forged perfection Shai had granted him. He reached deeper, past the elegant logic and the borrowed memories, into the screaming abyss of his own brokenness. He embraced the memory of his soul’s undoing, the searing pain of being unmade. It was the only way.

To counter a Forgery that unmade reality, he had to understand the process intimately. Using his own trauma as a key, he saw the heretic’s work not as a wall, but as a sentence being written. With a roar that was part agony and part triumph, Ashravan seized the narrative. He didn’t erase the Forgery; he rewrote it. He took the heretic's chaotic grammar and gave it syntax, transforming the spell of decay into a ward of preservation. The palace solidified, stronger than before, infused with his will. He stood, shaking and spent, no longer a forgery or a ghost, but Ashravan. Whole.`,
